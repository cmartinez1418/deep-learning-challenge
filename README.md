# deep-learning-challenge

Assignment using machine learning and neural networks to help the nonprofit organization Alphabet Soup select applicants to fund that have the highest likelihood of success in their ventures. A binary classifier is used for predictions. The dataset was cleaned and organized into bins before the model was run. Other versions of the model were also created in an attempt to get a higher accuracy. The amounts of columns that were dropped, the amount in each bins were changed, and the number of epochs were changed to try and make a more accurate model.
